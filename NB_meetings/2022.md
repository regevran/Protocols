| Flat Containers     |

## Meeting summary: 

### Attendees:
-  Inbal Levi
-  Andrei Zissu
-  Yehezkel Bernat
-  Dvir Yitachaki
-  Michael Peeri

### Minutes:
- We've discussed flat_map and flat_set in length:
   - The motivation for the proposals
   - The structure of the papers
   - Design details: container vs. adaptor
   - Few suggestions / queries came up:
     - Exception (weak) guarantees
     - Ctor with initial size

- The suggestions were brought up to Zach (at C++Now), which responded the following:
   - Exception guarantees: a weak guarantee (guarantee no "wrong" actions will be done) and not a strong guarantee, in case of a failure the (whole) container will be erased.
   - Container size in the ctor: Zach thinks that not only implementation-wise but also API-wise the correct thing will be to pass a pre-defined container (with the limited size), otherwise we will have to provide changes in the API for both cases.

|std::generator paper (P2502)|

## Meeting summary:
### Attendees:

- Inbal Levi
- Andrei Zissu
- Michael Peeri
- Eyal Amir
- Tamir Bahar
- Dvir Yitzchaki
- Ran Regev

### Minutes:
- We discussed std::generator design issues:
  -  The question of API and ABI breaks.
  -  Return values (by reference / value)
  -  Connection to `ranges`

- We took the same poll as LEWG, to collect the group's view:
  __POLL: The first generator we release must supprot yielding nested generators
  |F|N|A|
  |-|-|-|
  |2|2|3|
  
  Seems like our direction aligned with LEWG's, but we feel less strong about delivering std::generator in C++23.
