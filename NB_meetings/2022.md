## Agenda:

|std::generator paper (P2502)|

## Meeting summary:
### Attendees:

- Inbal Levi
- Andrei Zissu
- Michael Peeri
- Eyal Amir
- Tamir Bahar
- Dvir Yitzchaki
- Ran Regev

### Minutes:
- We discussed std::generator design issues:
  -  The question of API and ABI breaks.
  -  Return values (by reference / value)
  -  Connection to `ranges`

- We took the same poll as LEWG, to collect the group's view:
  __POLL: The first generator we release must supprot yielding nested generators
  |F|N|A|
  |-|-|-|
  |2|2|3|
  
  Seems like our direction aligned with LEWG's, but we feel less strong about delivering std::generator in C++23.
