## Meeting summary: 

### Attendees:
- Inbal Levi
- Michael Peeri
- Andrei Zissu
- Ran Regev
- Alex Dathskovsky
- Tal Yacobi

### Minutes:
- Inbal: Presenting a [summary of the solutions proposed](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PA9L_UqZbaXoX89JhuQtDKGKiaSdaV9Aa3JaKT44KLE/edit?usp=sharing) and additional solutions (5, 6)
- Inbal: We still need to move forward with a language solution, to understand how it affects the library one. I would like to see it before C++26. Among other things, we can't accept "tuple" in NTTP
- Alex: I agree with Inbal that this is better as a language feature.
- Inbal: Interesting, I think you were advocating for the opposite last time.
- Andrei: Alex, can you show us the comparison you said you're working on?
- Alex: Not ready, I was occupied with a lot of work.
- Inbal: OK, let us know when you want to show it.
- Ran: I think having a library and then a language solution is OK
- Inbal: Technically I agree, but the problem is we can't "remove" utils, which will mean we will end up with a "no-op" facility in the library after the language feature lands.
- Alex: Maybe we can extend NTTP to accept "tuples"
- Inbal: I agree, it would be a good direction to explore. I would also suggest to explore "implicit" propagation of `constexpr` in params.
- Inbal: Let's take a poll on proposed solutions and which one we like best. It could be that multiple solutions may be needed to solve the full problem space, or that they are dependent

Which solution do we like the most:

| |  |
|-|-|
| std::constexpr_v (P2781) | 3 |
| constexpr function params (P1045) | 2|
| Loose NTTP restrictions |4|
| constexpr functions propegate constexpr in params implicitly | 2 |

- Dvir Yizchaki

### Minutes:
- Andrei: presenting P1045
- Inbal: The second paper scheduled is the one we want to compare to. In Kona I asked EWG to look at it, as I think we can avoid the library feature and have the language feature.
- Alex: We can do everything here using a library feature, I think we should do that.
- Inbal: The point of this discussion is to explore if that's the case, and which is preferable. I would prefer language features, to avoid code clutter.
- Ronen: We can't do overload resolution
- Inbal: Correct.
- Andrei:

## Meeting summary: 

### Attendees:
- Inbal Levi
- Dvir Yitzhaki
- Andrei Zissu
- Ran Regev
- Michael Peeri
- Gal Zaban
- Yehezkel Bernat

### Minutes:
- Inbal: We have the "policy" paper, I would be happy to get more papers on library evolution policies
- Yehezkel: I opened a bug at Cpp2. I believe this shouldn't be done for C++. Will follow up on the topic.
- Dvir: (presenting P3019). This is useful.
- Dvir: I found a bug in non copyable example	https://godbolt.org/z/v883KdMdb
- Inbal: This will be discussed in LEWG, I would be happy to have more reviewers. Feel free to give feedback to authors / open issues in the repo (https://github.com/jbcoe/value_types/issues)
- Ran: I had progress with "Tooling" group members. They are recruiting, there's a need for more help. There is an initial draft, but it doesn't contain much.
- Inbal: I agree, it's important. Let me know if you'd like help getting into this topic. The first time "C++ Ecosystem International Standard" was on 2022-10-13 (about a year ago).
- Inbal: Our "reflection" group is still active, we're focusing on P2996 and looking for proposals for reflection-based libraries. All are welcome to join.

### Minutes:
- Andrei presents P2771, P2782, P2784 in the context of Safety
- Inbal mentions the first paper was discussed during Issaquah (Safety and security telecon), and got positive support. She also mentions this topic is focused on by the committee
- Ran talks about Opting out of zero-init of atomic objects. Views easiness of use as a disadvantage, as we don't want people to opt out. Mentions the option of having in addition to syntax a flag by the compiler. Some discussion on if this will increase the complexity of the implementation
- Inbal says it isn't connected - the implementation doesn't have to use pre-processing just because a flag is set. These are separate topics.
- Tamir mentions he doesn't like the idea of having two different indications for activating a feature
- Inbal agrees this can be a source of errors
- Discussion on the paper and possible improvements

There's a followup paper by Tim: [P2799R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2799r0.html): Closed ranges may be a problem; breaking counted_iterator is not the solution.
- Inbal: I believe we can have a wider fix to address these issues. Creating an adaptor will be useful. 
- Yehezkel presented the paper and the discussion from his prespective. Says even though the paper wasn't accepted, he enjoyed having it discussed in SG9 and LEWG.
- Andrei and Dvir discuss about alternative solutions and the details of the proposed solution in the paper
- Inbal talks about the status of current and future C++ and an overview of WG21's work in Issaquah, including the "Safety" topic
